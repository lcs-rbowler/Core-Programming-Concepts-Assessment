 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName = "Book"
let authorName = "Author"
let yearPublished = 1993
print("Since the book names and dates cannot be changed")
print("it makes sense to use constants to avoid any")
print("accidental or unwanted changes.")
var sellingPrice = 30
var copiesSold = 12
print("The amount of copies sold could always go up so")
print("we want to use a variable so the value becomes mutable.")
print("I listed the selling price as a variable as well since")
print("the selling price could vary between store to store")
print("or when the books go on sale.")
